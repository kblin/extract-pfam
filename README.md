# Utility scripts to extract PFAM or TIGRFAM domains from antiSMASH results

## How to run

Make sure you have `orjson` installed in the Python virtual environment you're
running in. Then, both scripts take a file containing the filenames to extract
from, one per line, and the output file name to write to.
